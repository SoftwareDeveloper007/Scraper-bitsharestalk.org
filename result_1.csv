Reason for Sharp Rise of $61M BTS traded on Jul.23rd?,"Hi All!My first post.  Lurking around for awhile. Very thankful that I invested almost 10 bitcoins to buy AGS back in early 2014. Now it has grown to an amount that changes my financial situation.  Much appreciation to the founders and core devs for the continuous development!!Question to those in the know:  What factors caused the 61 million dollars worth of BTS traded hands on Jul.23rd, then the fall back to earth the last couple of days?Unless I missed something from the state of the network report?Hope someone can share some insight!- David","July 27, 2017, 07:24:00 PM","https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php/topic,24713.0.html?PHPSESSID=85be7ei271j1jonvd6marifas5"
Bit20 - The cryptocurrency index fund,"But how exactly is it made, what are the coins in it and how can I invest in it?I'm here to share with you this promising blockchain project and answer all your questions. I wanted to create a tool that allows anyone to invest in the global economic growth of cryptocurrencies without a headache. Just buy something that will track this soon economic Cambrian explosion.This tool had to be decentralised because we all know how centralised projects dealing with money end up, especially in the cryptocurrency world. So my team and I have created a cryptocurrency index fund (ETF like).I want to spread the information about this index fund in the crypto community so everyone can invest in a great asset that will grow as the cryptocurrency global market grows. Not something going up and down wildly, but more something like a monster slowly waking up and devouring the fiat money markets.I want it to be a place where you can store your value with a high probability that months later, you will still have your investment intact and a nice return on investment.I also want to spread the word out of cryptocurrencies. My plan is to start with the cryptocurrency savvy crowd and then move on to trading forums, forex, stock markets and others. This is how I aim to make new money comes into this space. The bigger the index daily volume will grow, the easier is going to be to promote it and make people interested in crypto.The index took almost a 2 years to be fully tested and heavily reviewed. It´s finally ready and has been officially launched on the BitShares decentralised exchange on 16/12/2016. The index is fully decentralised and every Bit20 will always be backed by a minimum of 175% of its value.Here is the evolution of Bit20 ober the last 18 month in $ :This is 100% secure, 100% decentralised, 100% pure cryptocurrency !If you have any question, please have a look on the website at the ""FAQ""  or ""About Bit20"" tab. If you don't find what you are looking for, I'll do my best to answer you in this post.www.bittwenty.comBitShares Decentralised Exchange pair (BTWTY : BTS)Web site FAQBitcoin.talk forum official threadSteemit official thread","July 27, 2017, 05:09:46 AM","https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php/topic,23606.0.html?PHPSESSID=85be7ei271j1jonvd6marifas5"
Fees Report,"Greetings everyone,Ten days ago, @tbone put out a call for information about the total fees collected on the network. I compiled this information for the time period from the blockchain's start, in October  2015, through March 2017. The report is available  here.Please note several things about what the report is and is not:the fees in the report are merely the fees collected by the blockchain network and which are later distributed to various accounts. These fees are a superset of the fees that are ultimately distributed to the network’s fee pool;the document does not report on the volume of activities on the blockchain; rather it is focused on the fees collected as a result of the activities;the document does not report on the subsequent distribution of the collected fees to entities such as the network, witnesses, worker proposals, asset issuers, referrers, nor lifetime member accounts;the quantities that are reported in the document are all in terms of the asset units that were specified for fee payment (e.g. BTS, bitGold, etc.) and are not expressed in terms of any common asset unit.In summary, fees were collected in terms of 349 assets. The total fees collected in the core asset, BTS, are 47,106,798 BTS. The leading types of operations that generated the fees in BTS are listed below.Operation Type % of Total BTSAsset Create 48%Account Upgrades 26%Account Create 17%Limit Order Create 3%Transfer Operation 2%Asset Publish Feed 1%Vesting Balance Withdrawal 1%The details of the data are presented in different ways to help with analyzing them in different ways. Appendix A categorizes the collected fees in percentage terms for every operation type. Appendix B contains the nominal fees for every type of operation which is helpful especially when a particular operation might have a relatively low quantity of fees which would be hidden when expressed solely in percentage terms.If you do encounter any errors in the report, please let me know and I will correct the report as soon as possible.","July 26, 2017, 08:15:32 AM","https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php/topic,24027.0.html?PHPSESSID=85be7ei271j1jonvd6marifas5"

BTS in Bisq what do you think?,"Hi all,The exchange P2P Bisq https://bitsquare.io/ integrates BTC LTC DOGE and DASH as base currency.The DASH integration whit Bisq was done by DASH devs.I think it would be a great idea to integrate the bitshares wallet with Bisq.

Order matching bug (when margin call order is on the book),"Traders often place orders outside the spread (i.e. buy orders above the best offer, or sell orders below the best bid).  The expectation is that the order matching engine will walk the order book sequentially until the order is filled.  This is how the trading engine of every platform I have ever seen works. However, this does not work on the DEX as expected under one particular condition.  It appears that when there is a margin call order on the book and the user places an order with the same price, the order matching engine matches the user's order with the margin call order, completely skipping the orders on the book that are inside the margin call order. This issue was discovered by @alexpmorris, who posted about it on steemit.com, which sparked some discussion:http://bit.ly/2tKiDfbThe ability to place orders outside the spread is particularly necessary in cryptocurrency trading, where the quantity of tokens available at the best bid or best ask is so often less than the quantity a trader is interested in buying or selling.  In the vast majority of cases, the DEX handles such orders as expected.  But this edge case could cause people to lose confidence in the platform and should therefore be corrected ASAP.P.S.  I understand there are several fixes queued up for the next hard fork.  Does anyone know when that is expected to happen?  If it's not soon, perhaps a temporary fix should be made in the UI pending the next hard fork containing this fix?",Today at 07:30:37 PM,"https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php/topic,24715.0.html?PHPSESSID=85be7ei271j1jonvd6marifas5"
Build a dApp on top of Bitshares without altering the Bitshares protocol?,"I am looking for a home for a dApp I will be developing shortly.I had an idea recently that it may be possible to create a dApp in Bitshares without any changes to the Bitshares protocol.Is this even possible? I think it may be, but there are others on this forum that are much more knowledgeable on Bitshares tech than I...A. Create an alternative GUI/wallet, separate from Bitshares' wallet.A1. Custom dApp logic will be stored client-side.A2. The Bitshares blockchain will be used to keep issue tokens, send/receive tokens, trade tokens, and as an immutable database (by use of either the memo field, price feed publications, or some other available transaction property...  like Bitcoin's OP_Return transaction property... I am not really sure what is available with Bitshares or how flexible price feed publications are).B. Issue an asset.C. Leverage dynamic account permissions to autonomously change the account permissions proportionately to asset owners.C1. Consensus will be reached by majority rules. Someone would need to obtain 51%+ of the asset supply to do a hostile takeover.C2. Incentive to follow the rules (code) of the dApp will be enforceable by autonomous asset seizing.C2a.Everyone has the rules (code) of the dApp client-side, so there is no excuse for not following them.C3. Allow users to choose a proxy so they do not need to maintain an online client for their stake to secure the dApp.Pretty simple idea really... what do you guys think?","July 27, 2017, 05:22:08 AM","https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php/topic,24709.0.html?PHPSESSID=85be7ei271j1jonvd6marifas5"

"Lets bring "" earn x% interest on 'anything' "" back to Bitshares!","Yo,One of the major selling points of BTSX for me back in 2014 was the 5% (or x%) on 'anything' marketing (that and sharedrop theory). The idea that I could store MPAs/UIA in effectively my own bank and get better interest rates than that FIAT banks were offering was a powerful message that had me (and a lot of other users) sold.I realise that in the migration from BTSX (BTS 0.x) to BTS 2.0 we removed 'socialized yield', however I believe that the removal of profit sharing though asset fee yields was a mistake.https://bitshares.org/blog/2015/06/08/lessons-learned-from-bitshares-0.x/#socialized-yield-is-brokenThe following quotes are from the above link.QuoteUnder BitShares the BitAsset holders receive a yield simply by holding BitUSD. This yield was between 1% and 5% APR on average. Unfortunately, yield harvesting can happen at any time by someone shorting to themselves to gain a very low risk return and undermining goal of encouraging people to buy and hold BitUSD. The yield was funded from transaction fees and by interest paid by shorts.The funding of yield through fees was successful despite the fluctuating rates (1 - 5% APR AVG).The issue was that users were able to 'yield harvest' by shorting to an alt account, effectively cheating the system.An alternative distribution mechanism to paying interest by shorting is required.Peerplays has the ability to distribute 'dividends' to users that hold the peerplays tokens, we should be doing something similar for tokens on the BTS DEX. Hopefully peerplays dividend/profit-sharing code is somewhat compatible with Bitshares (it's using graphene after all).Relevant peerplays docs:http://www.peerplays.com/news/how-does-the-profit-sharing-function-work/https://peerplays.com/docs/Peerplays_Whitepaper.pdfQuoteAs we stated previously, undercharging for transactions is bad for business and BitShares was effectively earning nothing for all transactions of BitUSD because 100% of the income generated from fees was paid out to BitUSD holders as yield and nothing was left over to cover network expenses.We now gather 20% of fees into the reserve pool (which also contains over 1 Billion BTS), which goes towards workers and witnesses.80% of fees go towards the referral system.I would propose that we re-evaluate the distribution of fees between the reserve pool, referral system and asset holders. We could burn through a chunk of the reserve pool, but this would be temporary as we would eventually need to reintroduce such fees to build the reserve pool back up. I think it's most fair to take a chunk of the fees from the referral system.Infographic showing current BTS cashflow:https://i.imgur.com/uLxEMat.pngQuoteWhile Socialized Yield is broken, BitShares 2.0 offers a far better alternative: Collateralized Bonds. Collateralized Bonds enable arbitrary shorting between any two assets, guaranteed interest, and no risk of being force settled. This system privatizes the yield to individual bonds and the terms and leverage available can be far more flexible. In effect, BitUSD becomes cash and a Bond becomes a Certificate of Deposit.The concept of ""Collateralized Bonds"" did not make it into Bitshares 2.0, so in effect we cut asset holders out of fee redistribution without providing a replacement source of income for holding assets on the Bitshares DEX. I believe this may be a reason why we had a downtrend when switching from 0.x to 2.0 (disregarding merge drama).Does anyone have any further information on this collateralized bond market? I could only find the following:https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=16752.0https://bitshares.org/technology/collateralized-bond-market/---Edit:Recent related threads:""New Bitshares Dividend Idea"" https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php/topic,23706.0.html""Dividend feature"" https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php/topic,21476.msg279498.html#msg279498""Incentivize SmartCoin collateralization"" https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php/topic,23707.0.html---What do you think?

I want to start a currency on the bitshares platform.,I'm a complete novice when it comes to the inter workings of cryptocurrency development.But I'm hoping that bringing my vision here will shed light on how to accomplish my goal.I have the vision just not the road map on how to get there.So here we go:I want to build a cryptocurrency or smartcoin that is an asset that can be traded for goods.Lets say I'm building a coin just for my town and I want everyone to use the coin at our local businesses.Ideally I also need a way that online carts and payment processors can exchange the currency for goods.Ex: You go into a store with your cryptowallet and exchange from your wallet to the stores seamlessly.I believe this can be done with bitshares because of its fast transaction speed.That my idea in a nutshell.Is this plausible?I'd appreciate any insight from fellow members,"July 23, 2017, 03:32:30 AM","https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php/topic,24690.0.html?PHPSESSID=85be7ei271j1jonvd6marifas5"

Morning of sorrow,"Today I send $800 worth of bitAssets to a wrong address with similar name with my own account. Ouch! I had a ""Send"" form opened with the wrong address typed in and I sent two transactions in a row. How stupid is this! I send a message with request to kindly return my funds back, but I doubt that this will happen, because the receiver account was inactive since it was created 8 month ago. I know that there is nobody to blame here except myself, but I also know that this mistake is not very uncommon, since people report something like this from time to time. I wonder if something can be done to reduce a chance of this kind of mistakes on DEX. In regular payment system you contact a support and they halt a transaction. On DEX, there is nobody to contact, but could something like conditional payment take care of the problem? Suppose, two accounts communicate with each other through a smart contract. First account sends a payment request, second account replies with payment, then first account sends back payment confirmation, then second account verifies that confirmation came from the same account where funds were intended to be sent, and then the payment becomes final, otherwise funds are returned to originator. Is something like this possible to make on blockchain?","July 23, 2017, 02:24:41 PM","https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php/topic,24688.0.html?PHPSESSID=85be7ei271j1jonvd6marifas5"

BitShares Hangout #30 - 2017-07-21 - OpenSource Agenda [Workers Earn BeyondBit!],"BitShares Hangout Open Source Agenda has been Launched!""Join weekly to speak with founding community members of the BitShares Enterprise Dex about history, current events in cryptocurrency, worker proposals in BitShares and earn some free WhaleShares Tokens!"" ~@officialfuzzyThe Format of these Hangouts:These hangouts will have a moderator who will go through a list of worker proposals and other useful crowdsourced voluntary information that is brought to the steemit thread where I post these hangout announcements.  Those who join these hangouts as audience members will receive random sharedrops of whaleshares tokens to upvote their own bitshares (and beyondbitcoin of course) related content.  Those who join with Worker proposals ill get a Guaranteed 20 WhaleShares (approx $60 value) just for joining with a worker proposal.  If you are a worker who is joining with piles of work you have not already been paid for, you will likely receive MANY MORE whaleshares (which can bring you literally 1000's of dollars over the course of a single month) even if your worker proposal does not get voted in!Our hangouts will range from 45-60 minutes and the moderator will do his best to move seemlessly through topics at hand.  Do you want to get some resources or working on your passion---bitshares?  We can help you! But only if you help us...What will I get from Participating?I'm really changing things around after a long week of thinking.  Since the tools I've needed for so long are finally becoming available and beyondbitcoin has grown to have over 3000 weekly listens on soundcloud alone (not including youtube and bitchute platforms).  WhaleShares has now opened up the opportunity for me to even pay out in steem dollars, steempower, reputation and visibility those posters who use the Steem platform  to represent the BitShares community--Ethereum is beating us currently on there!  So I want this thread to be a place where people post about issues, news, and MOST IMPORTANTLY worker proposals for the Bitshares Ecosystem. Over this past 4 years, I believe I have proven that I am willing to continue helping this community even through the hardest times. In short, I once wanted to build trust and prove my intentions for this project before asking what I saw many others over time receive (and take with little to no results).  But now I feel like it is a fair time to ask support from the community with whom I have bled on the field of crypto battle.  I will begin taking a bigger role if the community lets me.  But that first step requires your consideration as a proxy so these bitshares hangouts can become a place to not only show people how alive and vibrant this grassroots community effort is, but also show them that good works that are already done get rewarded in both reputation, recognition and funding. Please vote for browniedistro as proxy if you wish to be able to follow weekly worker proposals that join our hangout for coverage!https://openledger.io/account/account_name_here/voting/And if you join with a project I love but I and attendees cannot vote your project in BTS ecosystem, I will gladly reward you with some WhaleShares, where a full 100% upvote is worth nearly $400 worth of Steem so you can advocate your position outside of bitsharestalk and on our sister DAC where structural differences give me an edge in various potential ways.  So you should have NO FEAR in joining us as long as you are doing something good for the ecosystem!How Much Time Will I Have?Hangouts will be at least 45 minutes long, but depending on attendance and projects/topics to be covered may last up to 1 hour. Given this, we will try to stay with 4-5 core topics and will fit in others where possible.Is any topic off Limits?Yes. We reserve the right to learn from the newest trickster trolling steemit consistently searching for way to insert chaos into the equation and devise future strategies for negating these. Naturally if these efforts become ham-fisted attempts at shutting down free speech in honest conversations, the audience will hold us accountable.But with that said....pretty much anything can be covered--even up to and including current events. However, I personally will only be voting up stories that touch the blockchain in some way shape or form and will be asking the community to downvote absolute Rubbish!Please Post Additions to this Here so we can pay you for your contributions and help you increase the BTS Community's Strength in the strongest crypto-social network in the world!","July 20, 2017, 02:50:44 PM","https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php/topic,24672.0.html?PHPSESSID=85be7ei271j1jonvd6marifas5"

[ANN] RuDEX is Launching a Gateway For Peerplays,"Hello everyone!During the work on our fiat gateway we’ve came to the conclusion that the same tools can be used for cryptocurrency gateway. Since we’re enthusiasts of Graphene technology we’ve decided to begin with Graphene based chains, and Peerplays gateway will become first of such gates.In creation of our gateway we were aiming to allow the community to easily do its public audit. If you’re keeping an eye on those things, several weeks ago we’ve registered PPY ticker on Bitshares blockchain.During design and implementation of the gateway we were trying to solve the following challenges:- Security- Independency- Transparency and ease of audit- Strict correlation between amount of tokens in the wallet and on the DEX- Minimization of the fees- Ease of use- StabilityAmount of PPY on DEX will always be the same as the amount of PPY in the gateway’s wallet on Peerplays blockchain to fulfil the criteria of correlation between tokens in the wallet and IOU’s on the DEX. It means that you can always be sure that money don’t just appear on the DEX out of thin air. Here is how we achive this:On Bitshares side:- When you transfer tokens into Bitshares the required amount of tokens is issued- When you transfer tokens out of Bitshares the required amount is burnedThis way an amount of UIA PPY tokens is always the same as amount of funds on our gateways’s wallet. For Peerplays it is ‘rudex-gateway’ account.AUDIT:In the future audit of our gateways will have a separate section on our website. Right now you can use the following services for audit:- https://cryptofresh.com/u/rudex-ppy — for our gateway account on Bitshares DEX- https://peerplaysdb.com/@rudex-gateway — for our gateway wallet on PeerplaysOur aim was not only in giving people a handy instrument (we’re working on making it open source), but also increase decentralization, because more gateways on the DEX means lower centralization around one gateway.One of the differences of our gateway from currently existing is that as a Graphene ambassador we’re setting the market fees for chains that use this technology to 0%.And to give you an ability to transfer your tokens when other gateways are experiencing technical difficulties, we’re planning to launch a cross gateway service. Still it would be impossible to transfer out more funds than what exist on the public account of our gatway on Peerplays blockchain.In the future we’re planning to create similar gateways for other Graphene chains. After completing the public test of the gateway (approximately in two-three weeks) we’ll send a pull request upstream, so our gateway would become available in all other wallets and web-interfaces of Bitshares.It is possible that in time we’ll create gateways for such coins that, in our opinion, would be interesting to the market; but for non-Graphene chains some low market fees would be set.DISCLAIMER: Due to the limitations of memo format on Livecoin exchange, it is currently impossible to transfer PPY tokens from Livecoin to RuDEX. To complete a transfer we recommend using any of the Peerplays wallets.","July 22, 2017, 05:42:43 PM","https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php/topic,24685.0.html?PHPSESSID=85be7ei271j1jonvd6marifas5"

Bitshares BlockChain Explorer Community suggestions,"As some of you already know, the following is a development version of a new blockchain explorer i had been working on:http://bitshares-explorer.ioThe thread purpose is to discuss what the community will like to see in the different sections of the explorer. Please note this is a pure dev version with bugs all around that i will be fixing, there is no guarantee the explorer will be up all the time either in this stage specially while making changes.The technology behind and all that will be explained but i will like to get more input in regards to what to put here and there, ill take care by now on how to do it.This is an open source project that will be uploaded fully to github with mit licence. The full code is not uploaded yet because it is messy to present it in the community. All code will be uploaded to:https://github.com/oxarbitrage/bitshares-python-api-backendand https://github.com/oxarbitrage/bitshares-explorerWith that said, lets start by making suggestions to the dashboard, here is a pic of what we have now:We have 4 indicator boxes:- block number - updated as operations came in real time, i think this is important and should stay.- new users: is the accounts that the bitshares network made since the last maintenance time up to now. change to ?- bts market cap. change to?- 24 hs volume of bts/btc. change to ?then we have the operation types chart. the plan was to have the types in current maintenance interval plotted but not sure if is relevant.options can be:- keep the chart. this is the dashboard, if we keep the chart there it needs to plot the most relevant data a bitshares user may want to see.- chart can be removed and replaced with 4 more indicators. if so, what will be the complete list of 8 indicators the community will like to see here?i don't suggest more than 8 indicators(or 4 and the chart) as it will push the real time operations table too much to the bottom of the page.the operations table of the dashboard:- i think it should stay as it is but open to suggestions to add/remove any column.operation colors:- the full list can be seen here:http://bitshares-explorer.io:9009/#/feesif anyone want to suggest the operation colors please send color for each op in hex format(#FFFFFF = white).there is a lot to do but lets try to go over the dashboard first and move on section by section.thank you very much for reading.",Today at 04:56:12 AM,"https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php/topic,24508.0.html?PHPSESSID=85be7ei271j1jonvd6marifas5"
Adding (PART) Particl.io to Bitshares,"Hi Bitshares Community,im know about Bitshares a long time, read btswolf stuff back then. Very interesting. In the past 2 years when i cared mostly about Particl.io i totally forgot about Bitshares and i recently tried the Web Demo which was super cool (a Poloniex Experience, just decentralized).Thats why i wanted to ask how do i get my Favorite Coin on this Exchange ?Currently part is listed only on Bittrex which will change in the next days https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/particl/I contacted the support via Email before but didnt received any answers since weeks Thats why i liked to ask here.I ask now again because bittrex seems to charge 0,2 part per transaction which is like 1€ o.O what about the fees on bitshares exchange im sure they must be super low.Would really appreciate your help guys, keep up the good work and decentralize the whole exchanging process.Thank you","July 22, 2017, 06:12:51 PM","https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php/topic,24687.0.html?PHPSESSID=85be7ei271j1jonvd6marifas5"
BlockPay in Serious Trouble,"This is copied from a Steemit post on kencodes blog... Probably the reason behind the torching of BlockPay's market cap today.""@Chris4210 where are you?Today, my claws come out. I invested my entire life savings into those BLOCKPAY tokens because you promised us that we would get to “share in the rewards from BlockPay transactions as well as value increases from products built by the Company”.My life savings: http://cryptofresh.com/u/kencodeYour promise: http://cryptofresh.com/a/BLOCKPAY(more promises found on reddit, facebook, twitter, linkedin and more)The past couple weeks, Development has come to a crawl Chris, this is very damaging as my Developers and I have no idea where the money is. I heard you were starting another company with xeroc and some shark named constantin. Is that true? I even got word that you had my company formally Appraised? Is that true?I have still not been paid my salary, my bills are past due now, my babies are hungry and you know I sure as hell can’t afford a lawyer to track you down. Barely 2 weeks ago you emailed me and said “Current reserves are around 540 BTC + 25k Euro on Bank account”. Really?If that is true, then where is all that money?! I see you have been recently taking out hundreds of thousands of dollars, where did all that money go?!https://blockchain.info/address/37jDFfS9WJEPL33YivJbnjfQQNU5RjFWFYHow the hell are we going to be able to continue launching crypto products with no money Chris? A Bitshares Worker Proposal? Your investors never agreed to that!You agreed (multiple ways) that you would stop trying to take charge of my Developers and Rodrigo’s marketing team too. I guess you fail to remember him yelling at you and hanging up on you?? Even emailing you and telling you to stop it. Obviously that contract has also been breached. My Developers said that you contacted them and stated that you are in charge now and I am leaving my own company? Is that true?!You agreed (in person with your lawyer/father, and via email) that if more than $2000 was to be expensed that you would get my permission first! Where is the money?!Your investors deserve to know what I am building, every single week, at a minimum. People love it when I post my weekly technical reports and I will not stop writing them and posting them online to show off what we’re building (including links to our github commits). Apparently, because of this, a couple weeks ago your excuse was “you leave us with no choice but to stop all sales and marketing activities immediately” as if my reports were somehow damaging my own company. You’re kidding, right? If you quit, then why did you start flying around the world on a “BlockPay World Tour”? 1,095 Bitcoins wasn’t enough for you? Now I find out that you are hiding out somewhere in China with your girlfriend. WTF?!Our commits: https://github.com/kenCode-de?tab=repositories1,095 Bitcoins: https://blockpay.ch/newsroom/investor-relations/blockpay-reserves/There are currently 762 of us who have trusted you!!!! I’ll be damned if you’re going to steal all of the STEALTH tokens I bought for my company too.Holders: http://cryptofresh.com/a/BLOCKPAYSTEALTH tokens: http://cryptofresh.com/u/bitshares-munichAttempts to contact you and settle this matter by email, SMS and Telegram have failed. Hopefully this steemit post reaches you. You have left me no choice but to contact the Authorities.Chris, I was building crypto products before I even met you and refuse to let you destroy my company like this. I gave you 49% of BitShares Munich so that you would pay the bills, and get out there and start marketing the products that I built and continue to build (well, not as of late, obviously).Going public with this is the right thing to do, as transparency is required Chris! Of course this may damage the value of our BLOCKPAY tokens for a bit, but you have left me no choice. As you are well aware, I have always fought for my rights and I will do so once again. As an activist, I assure you I will not stop until you honor the contracts you have made with us, let us see your accounting, pay all of our invoices, answer my questions above, and settle this with me immediately. Since you Follow my blog here on steemit.com, we all know you have been notified. Just as before, I will also send you this notice via email, SMS and Telegram.More posts to come. Stay tuned, this may get bumpy.""","July 22, 2017, 05:42:59 PM","https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php/topic,24088.0.html?PHPSESSID=85be7ei271j1jonvd6marifas5"
